// About The OS:

SDG-OS (Super Duper Good Operating System) Is Made To Keep Your Private Things Private. Let's Say That You're On Your Normal Boring Operating System, And You Get Hacked. What Do You Do? Run Your AV,
And Hope For The Best? Well With SDG-OS, All You Have To Do Is Exit To The Configeration Screen, And Delete The VM. You Don't Have To Worry About Losing Your Important Data, Because It'll Be Saved In
A Secure Area In The OS, That Makes Rebuilding What You Had, Easy. Your Operating System Is Kept Safe By Being Encrypted With AES-265 Quantum Resistant Deniable Encryption, Which Makes It Impossible For Any Snooping Hacker To
Escape To Your Other VM(s).

SDG-OS Is More Than Just An Operating System. It Allows You To Run Everything Through A VPN That Keeps All Of Your Traffic On RAM, Doesn't Store Any Of Your Info Except Your Login Token, Only Allows
You To Purchase With Crypto, Is Cheap, And Uses Quantum Resistan Encryption. When LE Comes Knocking For Your Info, They Won't Ger Any, Because We Won't Have Any. It Also Gives You The Tools Needed To
Have Secure Communications Without Having To Worry About Any Bastards Watching You. You Can Also Use Quantum Resistant Deniable Encryption To Protect Your Secret Hentai Collection (weirdo) From Your
Wife. Now What Shall One Do If He Is Hacked?

Hacking SDG-OS Is Already Nearly Impossible To Do Effectivly Do To The Many Checks And Warnings That Are More Annoying Than Masqitos, But It Allows You To Simply Exit To The VM Configeration Screen,
And Change To A Different VM. SDG-OS Also Comes With Anti FingerPrinting. But How Does This Work? The OS Will Never Give Any Program Any Information That Could Be Used To Fingerprint Your Device Such
As Your OS Name, Browser, Bookmarks, Extentions, MAC Address
